
## Basic-Level AWS Interview Questions & Answers

1. What is AWS?
   AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide variety of services such as virtual servers (EC2), storage (S3), databases (RDS, DynamoDB), networking (VPC), and much more.


2. What are the main services provided by AWS?

   Compute: EC2, Lambda
   Storage: S3
   Databases: RDS, DynamoDB
   Networking: VPC , Route 53
   Security: IAM
   Monitoring:CloudWatch


3. What is EC2?
   EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a core AWS service that provides virtual servers in the cloud.


4. What is S3 and what are its storage classes?
   Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is AWS’s object storage service — used to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere.

   Standard , Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) , One Zone-IA , Glacier , Glacier Deep Archive


5. What is the difference between an EC2 instance and a Lambda function?

   EC2:  Virtual server you manage; suitable for long-running applications; good for full control, always-on apps
   Lambda:  Serverless, managed by AWS; great for short, event-driven tasks (like resizing an image after upload)


6. What is IAM and why is it used?
   IAM (Identity and Access Management) is AWS’s service for controlling who can access what in your AWS account.
   Create users and groups.
   Assign permissions using policies.
   Apply multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.


7. How does AWS VPC work?
   A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is your own isolated network inside AWS. It’s like having your own private data center in the cloud.


8. What is the difference between public and private subnets in a VPC?

   Public subnet: Has direct internet access via an Internet Gateway.
   Private subnet: No direct internet access; typically used for databases or internal services.


9. What is an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?
   ELB automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers, IPs) to ensure better performance and high availability. 
   There are 3 types of ELBs:
     Application Load Balancer (ALB) – Best for HTTP/HTTPS traffic with routing rules
     Network Load Balancer (NLB) – Handles high performance TCP/UDP traffic
     Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) – For third-party virtual appliances (firewalls, etc.)


10. What is Auto Scaling in AWS?
    Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to load — it scales out (adds instances) when demand increases and scales in (removes instances) when demand drops.



 ##  Intermediate-Level AWS Interview Questions & Answers



1. What are the different types of EC2 instance types?
   EC2 instances are categorized by use cases:
      General Purpose: Balanced CPU, memory	
      Compute Optimized: High-performance CPU
      Memory Optimized: RAM-intensive apps
      Storage Optimized: High IOPS / throughput
      GPU/Accelerated: GPUs / ML / HPC


2. What is the difference between EBS and S3?

   EBS (Elastic Block Store): Block storage for EC2 instances; Acts like a hard drive.
   S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage designed for storing and retrieving any amount of data; highly scalable, accessible over HTTP


3. How does Route 53 work in AWS?
   Route 53 is AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS) service. It translates human-friendly domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to connect.


4. Explain the concept of security groups and NACLs.

    Security Groups: Virtual firewalls at the instance level controlling inbound and outbound traffic. They are stateful, which means if you allow an incoming request, the response is automatically allowed. ***  instance-level, stateful, easier to manage.
    NACLs (Network ACLs): Operate at the subnet level and control inbound and outbound traffic to and from subnets. They are stateless, meaning you must explicitly allow both inbound and outbound traffic. *** subnet-level, stateless, additional security layer.


5. What is CloudWatch and how does it differ from CloudTrail?

   CloudWatch: A monitoring service that collects metrics, logs, and events to help you track the performance and health of your AWS resources and applications.
   CloudTrail: A logging service that records all API calls and actions taken by users or services in your AWS account. It’s used primarily for auditing and compliance.


6. What is the difference between AWS RDS and DynamoDB?

   RDS: Managed relational database service (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   DynamoDB: Fully managed NoSQL database for key-value and document storage.


7. Explain AWS Lambda's cold start issue.
   Cold start happens when a Lambda function is invoked after being idle for some time or scaled up to handle new requests. AWS has to initialize the runtime and code, which causes a delay (sometimes a few hundred milliseconds to seconds).


8. What are AWS Availability Zones and Regions?

   Regions: Geographical areas (e.g., us-east-1).
   Availability Zones (AZs): Data centers within a region; help ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

9. How do you secure data in transit and at rest in AWS?

   In transit: Use SSL/TLS encryption.
   At rest: Use AWS KMS to encrypt data in services like S3, RDS, EBS.

10. Explain the Shared Responsibility Model of AWS.
    AWS is responsible for the
          Security of the cloud
          Protecting infrastructure (hardware, software, networking, data center)
    while customers are responsible for
          Security in the cloud
          Managing user access (IAM), securing your apps, encrypting your data, updating your OS if using EC2, etc.




##  Advanced-Level AWS Interview Questions & Answers



1. How would you design a fault-tolerant architecture on AWS?
   
    A fault-tolerant architecture ensures your application stays available even when components fail.

   Multi-AZ deployment: Deploy resources across multiple availability zones.
   Auto Scaling: Automatically replace failed instances and adjust capacity based on load.
   Health checks: Route 53 with Health Checks + Failover Routing:
   RDS Multi-AZ: For databases — ensures high availability by maintaining a standby in another AZ.
