Descriptive Statistics:

1. What is the purpose of descriptive statistics?
Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. It helps in presenting raw data in a meaningful way using measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and visualizations like histograms and boxplots.

2. Can you explain the difference between mean, median, and mode?
Mean: The average of all values.
Median: The middle value when data is sorted in order.
Mode: The value that occurs most frequently in the dataset.


3. How do you interpret the standard deviation of a dataset?
Standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of data points around the mean.
A small standard deviation means data points are close to the mean.
A large standard deviation indicates data points are spread out over a wider range.


4. Describe the concept of skewness in statistics.
Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution of values.
Positive skew (right-skewed): Tail is longer on the right.
Negative skew (left-skewed): Tail is longer on the left.
Zero skewness: Data is perfectly symmetrical.


Inferential Statistics:

5. What is the main goal of inferential statistics?
Inferential statistics makes predictions, inferences, or decisions about a population based on a sample of data. It uses probability theory to estimate population parameters and test hypotheses.

6. Explain the difference between a population and a sample.
Population: The entire group we want to study.
Sample: A subset of the population used to represent the whole.
Example: Studying all students in India (population) vs. surveying 500 students (sample).


7. What is a confidence interval, and how is it useful in inferential statistics?
A confidence interval gives a range of values within which we expect the true population parameter to lie, with a certain level of confidence (commonly 95%).
It helps quantify the uncertainty of an estimate.


8. Define p-value.
The p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results of a statistical test, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
Low p-value (< 0.05): Strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
High p-value (> 0.05): Weak evidence against the null.
